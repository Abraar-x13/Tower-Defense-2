# Tower-Defense-2

This repo is the codebase for a **Tower Defense** game made in *Java* for Windows, Mac, and Linux for our **SWE 223 (OOPL)** project following a reference from [Kaarin Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1At_c5rKyxH4aWgGPqsRDg)'s code. 
This repo *doesn't mimic the tutorial*. We're adding/removing things we like or dislike to make the game Truly ours. For detailed explaination and the original code, visit [Tutorials](https://www.kaaringaming.com/tutorials). 
For our version, check [this](https://github.com/Abraar-x63/Tower-Defense) link. <br />
